### FCC ULS Database

The [FCC ULS databases](http://wireless.fcc.gov/uls/index.htm?job=transaction&page=weekly) are available as a download in a flat file format. Querying flat files isn't very easy, so to more easily manipulate the data and present it in a workable format we will import it into a relational database server.

If you have an operating MySQL database (MySQL, Percona, MariaDB) the following pages will assist you in getting the FCC data in a self-hosted SQL queryable format.

It will also be possible to query this data on the GA AMPRNet MySQL server if you have been granted access to the proper databases. By using the GA AMPRNet MySQL server, you can utilize the Views that have already been created for GA AMPRNet needs.
