### FCC ULS Database

The [FCC ULS databases](http://wireless.fcc.gov/uls/index.htm?job=transaction&page=weekly) are available as a download in a flat file format. Querying flat files isn't very easy, so to more easily manipulate the data and present it in a workable format we will import it into a relational database server.

If you have an operating MySQL database (MySQL, Percona, MariaDB) the code in this repo will assist you in getting the FCC data in a self-hosted SQL queryable format.
